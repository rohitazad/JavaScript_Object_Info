What is object 

  JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
  
  A property's value can be a function/array/string/boolean/object/number etc.
  
  In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a car, for example. A car is an object, with properties. A car has a color, a design, weight, mileage, oilType, function, a material it is made of, etc. The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.

```
  Object like :- car.color = 'white'

```
